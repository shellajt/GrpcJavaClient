# GrpcJavaClient
Based off of the [Google Tutrial](http://www.grpc.io/docs/quickstart/java.html).

To build the project execute ./gradle build from the projects root directory. Follow this with a ./gradle installDist command.

To run the client, ./build/install/examples/bin/adder-client is then used. The client will ask the server to add 5 and 4, and print the answer.
